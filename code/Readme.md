# <center><b> Server and client code 

## Theme of the code :


The FTP transfers between two directories are basically represented as confectionery
business transactions in the project. Two main directories Confectionery and Customer are 
created and files are transferred between them.
The built-in FTP protocol in python that just takes web address is not used, instead, the 
functions in the OS module of python are used to create an FTP server using GUI to take 
commands and socket programming with TCP to send the commands to the server and receive 
the information.
The server and client codes are run separately in different windows PowerShell tabs and the 
following output is observed. The customer can log into the service in the first window and 
avail of the services.

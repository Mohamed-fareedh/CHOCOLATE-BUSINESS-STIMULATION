# Cisco Packet tracer

## Stimulated the LS routing 
  * Order delivery through Link State Routing Protocol is then simulated in the CISCO Packet 
tracer. A network topology is built with PCs as houses, switches as traffic lights, and routers as
junctions in the city.
The orders as packets are then transferred from the confectionery to houses. The topology is built
with different bandwidths to different router-router interfaces and different IP addresses to
different PCs and all the routers with different process IDs following OSPF to build the 
forwarding table.

When a packet is dispatched, it follows the path with the least cost, i.e. less bandwidth total,
signifying less distance and fastest delivery (shortest path) from confectionery to the specified 
house according to the forwarding table

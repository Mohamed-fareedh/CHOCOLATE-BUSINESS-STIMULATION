<hr><hr>

<br><br>
## Abstract of the project :

  * the main idea is to combine different aspects and build an application using a Tkinter interface that can be portrayed as 
similar to simulating a chocolate business. FTP and SMTP can be used to manage services and 
maintain customer records through an appropriate graphical user interface. The link-state routing 
algorithm has been used to efficiently deliver the chocolates in a short and fast way
